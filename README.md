# Hello!

I am Benedek Fodor, an Electrical Engineering student from Hungary, Budapest, specialized in Communication Engineering, Media Technology.

I have been working since February 2022 as a developer and studio technician at the E-Learning department of Ã“buda University.\
This semester I'm doing an internship in Hotel Knorz, Germany. I'm managing their Social Media and make content.

I'm also responsible for the weekly church service with contemporary music in my home town community.
